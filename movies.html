        <p> This is a movie I choose to write an essay for in Japanses class. 
         I read a summary of the movie and was like this is perfect for my essay.
         When I watched it I still cried at the ending even tho I already knew the ending I cried watching the end. 
        Nice movie about the meaning of life</p>
